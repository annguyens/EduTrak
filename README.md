## Description
EduTrak is a time management meant to help students keep track of assignments by creating a to-do list of tasks that need to be completed. Users can manually upload tasks which can then be viewed on both our Calendar UI and List View of tasks. 

## Technologies Used
Integrated Development Enviroment --- Android Studio
Database and Authecation --- Firebase
Languages --- XML and Java
Collabration and Version Control --- GitHub

## Exceptions 
### Compotents Not Included
Some Compotents included in our inital Test Plan that are not implemented in our app include the Search feature for looking up tasks and the Automated Help Chatbot. 

### Partial Functionality 
The Schedule Scanner page is partially working. It allows to user to select a pdf file from their local storage and show the file path. However, the functionality to scan the selected file and upload the info from the pdf to the Calendar UI has not been implemented yet.
